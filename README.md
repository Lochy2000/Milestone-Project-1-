# The Art of Table Tennis
[live project]https://github.com/Lochy2000/Milestone-Project-1-/deployments/github-pages

## Project
Table tennis clubs can sometimes get the label as being a repetitive and slightly old fashioned. The concept was simple, create a slightly more interactive and creative aspect to table tennis. A table tennis club that offers workshops in bat building and design. The idea is that this will help grow the club by getting people invested in table tennis early on.  
This site in meant to be informative about the club and table tennis. The end goal is to get people to come down to a workshop or the club. This can be achieved in two ways by looking at the location and map or filling in a contact form.
